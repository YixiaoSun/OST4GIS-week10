# Week 10, Lab 2 â€” Introduction to Carto

## Task

This assignment is relatively open ended. Here are a few tasks you should complete:

- Sign up for the Github [student pack](https://education.github.com/pack)
- Upload a dataset to Carto
- Try to modify your dataset in the dataset editor (similar to a spreadsheet view)
- Try editing the CartoCSS so that different parts of your dataset have different styles
- Use the 'Wizards' tab, try three of the analysis types that seem especially interesting
- Pick the analysis type that looked the best; export the analysis to GeoJSON; you can
  reload this in Carto or use L.geoJson to map it
- Check out the public dataset library. As a stretch goal, see if you can pull of a spatial join between two different tables/datasets
